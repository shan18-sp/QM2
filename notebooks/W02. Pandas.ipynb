Let's examine the data and start to see what we can say about it. First of all, we have to find data - I'm interested in looking in data with a wide spread, so I looked for data on income in the UK.\n",

        "I ended up using data from 2011, generated from a study called the Family Resources Survey and collated and tweaked by an independent research unit called the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS). The \"tweaking\" they do tends to be around the size of the family unit, and other factors which create economies of scale - hence they \"equivalise\" it. The IFS is quoted in UK Government documents, so we can have some trust in their impartiality, or at least accuracy - of course, if we were publishing research about this, that's not really good enough and we'd want to reproduce, or at least understand and critique, their methodology rather than just trusting it!\n",

        "When comparing the equivalised incomes of single adults and childless couples across different percentiles, a clear pattern emerges that highlights the economic implications of coupling. At the 1st percentile, single adults earn approximately £1,170.44, while childless couples have a slightly higher income of £1,746.92. This suggests that even at the lowest income levels, being part of a couple can provide a modest financial advantage. Moving to the 50th percentile, single adults have an equivalised income of £14,627.95, compared to £21,832.75 for childless couples. This significant gap indicates that coupling can lead to a more substantial economic benefit as individuals progress toward the median income bracket. Finally, at the 99th percentile, the disparity becomes even more apparent, with single adults earning £73,023.80 and childless couples earning £108,990.74. This stark difference suggests that higher incomes are more attainable for couples, reinforcing the notion that coupling may offer greater financial stability and resources. Overall, the data illustrates that coupling not only tends to enhance income across all percentiles but also suggests a potential economic advantage that could be attributed to shared resources and combined financial support. Interestingly, the figures consistently show that a childless couple makes 1.49 times more money than single adults in all three percentiles."
